        <h1>Tianchi Zhao</h1>
        <p>In June 2018, I graduated from <a href="https://www.cqust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Chongqing University of Science and Technology</a>.</p>
           <p>Around 2019, I joined the Engineering Department of <a href="https://www.kilowood.com" target="_blank">Chengdu Chenglin CNC Tool Co., Ltd.</a> as a Mechanical Engineer. </p>
           <p>Around 2021, I took on the role of Project Leader at Nanjing Lego Medical Devices Co., Ltd. </p>
           <p>Since September 2023, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ts_v2uoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra" target="_blank">Professor Gongbo Zhou</a>, 
          I have been engaged in research in the fields of artificial intelligence, mechanical health monitoring, and signal processing, which I have found both fulfilling and enjoyable.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ’¼ Work Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Chengdu Chenglin CNC Tools Co., Ltd.</strong> â€“ Mechanical Engineer (2019 ~2020)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participated in the development of new products (e.g., hydraulic tool holders) and the preparation of a complete set of technical documentation, including engineering drawings (Proe, CAD) and process sheets.</li>
        <li>Responsible for the design of non-standard turning and boring tools, including eccentric turning tools, modular tool heads, and precision-adjustable boring heads.</li>
        <li>Tool manufacturing often requires on-site problem solving, through which I have accumulated extensive experience in machining operations and fieldwork.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Nanjing Lego Medical Devices Co., Ltd.</strong> â€“ Project Manager (Nov.2020 ~Aug.2023)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Served as the project leader for new products such as the phototherapy device and sterilizer, coordinating departments including procurement, electronics, and assembly to ensure successful project completion.</li>
        <li>Conducted in-depth research on product principles and designed the overall solution, sheet metal components, light source module, and thermal management system.</li>
        <li>Prepared assembly process sheets and product inspection specifications, and communicated with and guided production line personnel in assembling the instruments.</li>
        <li>Made multiple visits to regulatory agencies for medical device evaluation, assisting in the assessment process including risk analysis, technical specifications, and user manuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ›  Master Research</h2>
      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearings in Mining Double-Toothed Roll Crushers under Complex Operating Conditions(Sep.2023 ~present)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Participated in the 2024 Jiangsu Postgraduate Academic Innovation Forum on Advanced Equipment and Intelligent Manufacturing as a presenter in the field of mechanical health monitoring.</li>
        <li>Published a paper as the fourth author titledã€ŠDesign and simulation analysis of a dual-source magnetic loop structure for mining steel wire ropeã€‹.</li>
        <li>Built an integrated test rig capable of simulating faults in rolling bearings and planetary gear reducers.</li>
        <li>Authored a paper titled "A Novel Dual-Core Adaptive Nonlocal Sparse Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis", in which physical interpretability, generalization capability, and stability were experimentally validated.</li>
        <li>Authored another paper titled "Enhancing Interpretability via Fine-Grained Targets: A Manifold Learning-Based Structured Model for Bearing Fault Diagnosis under Noisy Conditions".The proposed model features an interpretable diagnostic chain, high recognition accuracy, strong robustness, and generalization capability.</li>
        <li>Currently developing a novel dictionary learning framework based on permutation matrices and relaxed block-diagonalization. By learning permutation matrices in a data-driven manner to align identical fault patterns across different domains, the framework enables robust, resilient, and unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis for aerospace bearings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ§  Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proficient in SolidWorks, Proe, CAD.</li>
        <li>Skilled in programming with Python, C, and MATLAB.</li>
        <li>Proficient in solving multivariate convex optimization problems, such as block coordinate descent and ADMM.</li>
        <li>Experienced in a wide range of optimization algorithms and solution techniques.</li>
        <li>Experienced with various artificial intelligence models.</li>
        <li>Proficient in signal processing methods based on dictionary learning (convex formulations) and their variants.</li>
      </ul>
