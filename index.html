        <h1>Tianchi Zhao</h1>
        <p>In June 2018, I graduated from <a href="https://www.cqust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Chongqing University of Science and Technology</a>.</p>
           <p>Around 2019, I joined the Engineering Department of <a href="https://www.kilowood.com" target="_blank">Chengdu Chenglin CNC Tool Co., Ltd.</a> as a Mechanical Engineer. </p>
           <p>Around 2021, I took on the role of Project Leader at Nanjing Lego Medical Devices Co., Ltd. </p>
           <p>Since September 2023, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ts_v2uoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra" target="_blank">Professor Gongbo Zhou</a>, 
          I have been engaged in research in the fields of artificial intelligence, mechanical health monitoring, and signal processing, which I have found both fulfilling and enjoyable.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ’¼ Work Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Chengdu Chenglin CNC Tools Co., Ltd.</strong> â€“ Mechanical Engineer (2019 ~)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I participated in the development of new products (such as hydraulic tool holders) and the preparation of a complete set of technical documentation, including engineering drawings (Proe, CAD) and process sheets.</li>
        <li>I was responsible for designing turning and boring tools, including eccentric turning tools, modular tool heads, multi-hole boring tools, and fine-adjustable boring heads â€” all customized non-standard tools.</li>
        <li>Since tool manufacturing often requires on-site problem solving, I have accumulated extensive experience in machining operations and field support. I am also familiar with commonly used materials (42CrMo) and surface treatment processes such as quenching, tempering, blackening, and borax treatment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Nanjing Lego Medical Devices Co., Ltd.</strong> â€“ Project Manager (2021 ~)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As the project leader for new products such as the photon therapy device and dry-heat sterilizer, I coordinated multiple departmentsâ€”including procurement, electronics, and assemblyâ€”to ensure successful project completion, thereby gaining extensive experience in project management.</li>
        <li>By conducting in-depth research on competing products and designing the overall schematics, sheet metal components, light source modules, and heat dissipation systems using SolidWorks, I significantly enhanced my innovation capabilities.</li>
        <li>I was also responsible for drafting standard operating procedures and internal product specifications to guide production line personnel in prototype assembly, which fostered strong interpersonal and communication skills. </li>
        <li>In addition, through multiple business trips to regulatory agencies for medical device evaluation, I assisted in the inspection process (including risk analysis, technical specifications, and instruction manuals for the photon therapy device), further honing my technical communication abilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ›  Master Research</h2>
      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearings in Mining Double-Toothed Roll Crushers under Complex Operating Conditions</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a test rig combining rolling bearings and a parallel gear reducer.</li>
        <li>authored a paper titled "A novel dual-core adaptive nonlocal sparse network for bearing fault diagnosis", aiming to enhance denoising performance of bearing signals under strong noise and improve diagnostic accuracy.</li>
        <li>Authored another paper titled "Enhancing interpretability via fine-grained targets: a manifold learning-based structured model for noisy condition bearing fault diagnosis", which successfully diagnoses three challenging bearing faults in noisy environments.</li>
        <li>Currently, a novel dictionary learning approach is being developed, based on permutation matrices and relaxed block-diagonalization, designed to align similar fault patterns across different domains through transposed matrix optimization, enabling robust cross-condition fault diagnosis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>ðŸ§  Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proficient in SolidWorks, Proe, CAD.</li>
        <li>Familiar with solving multivariate convex optimization problems (e.g., block coordinate descent, ADMM).</li>
        <li>Skilled in programming with Python, C, and MATLAB.</li>
        <li>Experienced with various artificial intelligence models.</li>
        <li>Proficient in signal processing methods based on dictionary learning (convex formulations) and their variants.</li>
      </ul>
